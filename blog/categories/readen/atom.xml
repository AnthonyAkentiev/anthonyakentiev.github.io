Here is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Launch-Pad-Combinator-Exclusive-Startups-ebook/dp/B00AFLLS3W">link</a>.</p>

<h3>How to tell STARTUP from BUSINESS (even big)?</h3>

<p>Stross has good clear view of what &ldquo;startup&rdquo; means today: yes, it is only about fast pace and scalability. Everything that is not fast and scalable is ORDINARY BUSINESS. Kawasaki-Ries-Blank have said that many times.</p>

<p><em>Do you think Microsoft was a STARTUP in 80th?</em></p>

<p>The other interesting thought for me is probably about &ldquo;young means free&rdquo;. Author explains it in that way: we like youngsters not because they are smart and quick, but because they have no families and mortgages ))</p>

<h3>Quotes</h3>

<p><strong>On high stress in startups</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stress levels on our families were uncomfortably high &ndash; not something we&rsquo;d like to repeat&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says she was glad that she had not enjoyed a higher standard of living before coming to YC &ndash; it would have been harder to give up. We are giving up cafeteria food for ramen&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this how you want to spend the next 10 years?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>On women in startups</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Only 1.7 percent of venture capital-backed startups were founded by women&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y combinator founded only 14 female founders to date&hellip;&rdquo; (2010)</p>

<p>&ldquo;There had been only 1 instance in which there had been an all-female team, a pair of cofounders&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she asked women in Berkeley&rsquo;s computer science department what toys they had played with as children &ndash; and whether Barbies were among them &ndash; and the answers she received were consistent: no Barbies. Legos were favorite toy&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Some say Europeans are less energetic, but i don&rsquo;t believe it. I think the problem with Europe is not that they lack balls, but that they lack examples&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way to get really big returns is to do things that seem crazy &ndash; like starting a new search engine in 1998 or turning down a billion-dollar acquisition offer&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much luck involved with startups [that] you increase your odds of success by swinging the bat multiple times&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cadence of startup life is speeding up considerably&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Conslusion</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d give it 3+ out of 5 starts. I wanted to like this book, but there is not much new to me in it. Still, 3+ stars means that book is worth reading.</p>
