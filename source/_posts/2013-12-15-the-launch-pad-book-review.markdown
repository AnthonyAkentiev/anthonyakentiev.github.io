### How to tell STARTUP from BUSINESS (even big)?

Stross has good clear view of what "startup" means today: yes, it is only about fast pace and scalability. Everything that is not fast and scalable is ORDINARY BUSINESS. Kawasaki-Ries-Blank have said that many times.

*Do you think Microsoft was a STARTUP in 80th?*

The other interesting thought for me is probably about "young means free". Author explains it in that way: we like youngsters not because they are smart and quick, but because they have no families and mortgages ))


### Quotes

**On high stress in startups**

"Stress levels on our families were uncomfortably high - not something we'd like to repeat"

"She says she was glad that she had not enjoyed a higher standard of living before coming to YC - it would have been harder to give up. We are giving up cafeteria food for ramen..."

"Is this how you want to spend the next 10 years?"

**On women in startups**

"Only 1.7 percent of venture capital-backed startups were founded by women"

"Y combinator founded only 14 female founders to date..." (2010)

"There had been only 1 instance in which there had been an all-female team, a pair of cofounders"

"So she asked women in Berkeley's computer science department what toys they had played with as children - and whether Barbies were among them - and the answers she received were consistent: no Barbies. Legos were favorite toy"

**Misc**

"Some say Europeans are less energetic, but i don't believe it. I think the problem with Europe is not that they lack balls, but that they lack examples..."

"The way to get really big returns is to do things that seem crazy - like starting a new search engine in 1998 or turning down a billion-dollar acquisition offer"

"There's so much luck involved with startups [that] you increase your odds of success by swinging the bat multiple times..."

"The cadence of startup life is speeding up considerably..."

### Conslusion
I'd give it 3+ out of 5 starts. I wanted to like this book, but there is not much new to me in it. Still, 3+ stars means that book is worth reading.
