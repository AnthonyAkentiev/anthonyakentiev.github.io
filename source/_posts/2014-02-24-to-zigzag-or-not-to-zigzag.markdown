I am not really into this book, but it has one though that i liked: "First step in any business is getting profitability". Of course, there are a lot of business that are exceptions to this statement. You can easily recall YouTube and Twitter for example.

So that was Zig#1.

Zig#2 is "Once you are profitable - add additional resources".

Zig#3 is "Scale your business". Don't keep baking bread, spread the technology, so you will control many bakeries.

Author starts  with little story of "zigzagging through obstacles instead of going downhill straight to your goal". But  i still wonder why these **straightforward** steps are called **ZigZags** ))

Here is the [link](http://www.zigzagprinciple.com). Every book has own domain/site today?

# Quotes:

"What skills do i have that can get me to profitability the fastest?"

"First step in building foundation is assesing your resources"

"During this first Zig, it is important to remember that you are not going to have time to be perfect at everything. Many people that are perfectionsts or have a methodological personality fail at this stage because they try to be great and 
have everything perfect and buttoned upâ€¦"

"We worked fast and we worked hard, which meant we didn't always refine our effort to the point of perfection. In fact, in many cases we settled for **good enough**"

"A key reason many people have hard time adding a resource is they have become accustomed to micromanaging every aspect of their business"

"Mental Capital (our knowledge, skills, talents, passions) + Raltionship Capital (quality of our relationships with a broad pool of people) = Financial Capital"

"Most people spend 80% of their time worrying about things they can not control. In other words, they spend all of their time and energy focusing on their areas of concern rather than their area of influence" 

"Entrepreneurship is having the courage to wander in the fog"

"A goal needs to be: (1)written down, (2)measurable, (3)realistic"

"Resist change and die, adapt to change and survive, create change and thrive"

# Conclusion
Don't buy *"Become Next Steve Jobs in 30 minutes"*-style books.
