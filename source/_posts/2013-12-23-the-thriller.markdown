This is very engaging and entertaining book. I would rather call it "Soap Twitter" or "Behind-the-scenes of Twitter". It is fast-paced and easy to read. This book is not about technology, but about people. 

I was really surprised that Twitter was such a complete mess. 

### Here are the quotes

*Person One:*

"I never considered you a founder"

"What the fuck are you talking about? This is how VCs fuck up companies"

"The board wants you to step up to the chairman role"

"As far as he knew, he was 'doing a great fucking job!'"

"I really have no fucking idea who to believe anymore"

"What the fuck! So you're going behind his back to be CEO of the company! I can't believe it ..."

*Person Two:*

"He no longer looked like a himself: he began acting like the second coming of Steve Jobs"

"What is the worst thing i can do as CEO to fuck the company up?" -"Hire your fucking friends!"

"He had watched in disbelief as he realized he'd been completely erased from the Twitter history"

"You're giving me more than i deserve?"

"If you'll fire him, i'll quit"

"You leave the office to early. You go off to you dressmaking classes"

"He was acting like a cowboy"

*Person Three:*

"He is trying to push me out of company. I can feel it"

"Just a few blocks away, he wandered alone in the rain as his former friends and cofounders toasted to the award they had just won without him"

"A crimson stream of blood flowed down his cheek, past the drunken grin on his face"

*About Twitter:*

"If database goes down right now, we would lose everything..."

"This is fucking war! This is out enemy. We need a war map. They're going to attack us"

"We should go off and start our own Twitter"

"I'm not working for your fucking dot-coms"

"I really appreciate our friendship and don't want me investing, or us working together, to affect it..."

"Blogger wasn't a traditional startup. It didn't have a pool table, a fridge full of beer..."

"More vodka, more Red Bull, the digital music sounding like a tempo for each drink"

"Well! Well! How about you fucking be uncomfortable in reference to the entire fucking career of this guy? How about you be fucking uncomfortable?"

"He had cried hundreds of times over the years, cried a million tears. He had cried alone. In his bed"

### Conslusion 
The book is 5/5. I highly recommend this reading. It is rated 4,5/5 on Amazon. So you can believe me. It is well written and i really enjoyed it.
