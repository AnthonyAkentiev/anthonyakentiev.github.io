This [book](http://www.amazon.com/Networking-Not-Working-Collecting-Connections-ebook/dp/B00K436RH8) is about adding more value to people's lives.
Author claims - you can really use your network of people to GET what you want from them. But you need to GIVE some EXTRA value.

Imagine - if your dentist helped you to find exceptional car dealer in town. He didn't have to. But he did.
So he added little value that will (in LONG term only) possibly give him good relations with you. Maybe you will get him new customer, maybe you will mention him somewhere.

Ideas shortly:
1) Add value. Be "ultimate connector" or "ultimate tiebreaker" (both terms invented by author). Call your clients, help them do their job. Help them to find better attorney, car dealer, hockey rink, etc. 
2) Be careful to connect people only with people you know well )) 
3) Don't attend "networking events" because "networking is not working". 
4) Don't wait for quick return. Be focused on long-term relationship with good people.
5) Business cards don't work.

As to me - book is quite interesting, even though i have different opinion. I don't believe that these ideas helped author to really succeed in his business. The main problem is that these ideas will leave you unfocussed. 
I think that it's better to be focused on giving people great value by doing your JOB, not by some extra means...

Imagine Steve Jobs spending his time calling you to ask if your bakery is OK. And suggesting you better one. That is simply waste of his time. He probably gave you more value by doing his direct job ) Maybe this is rude example, but ...
