What if?

What if Microsoft allowed us to use C#/.NET on all platforms back in 2000s (or today)? 
Look at Objective-C or Java - they all **suck** compared to C#. Java is really way behind See-Sharp. 

What if they OPEN-SOURCE their platform and open all the code: Virtual machine, frameworks, etc?
Of course i am aware of Mono project )). It is a great product, but we want even more - we want support, we want freedom, we want C# on every platform (including mobile), we want that really neat language/framework to be everywhere.

I found that quote: 
> Android chief Andy Rubin wrote in a 2005 email, “If Sun doesn’t want to work with us, we have two options: 1) Abandon our work and adopt MSFT CLR VM and C# language – or – 2) Do Java anyway and defend our decision, perhaps making enemies along the way.

Imagine how different the world would be today if Google had chosen .NET instead of Java as the native development framework for the Android mobile operating system…

Microsoft still has this opportunity. They understand that Excel/Office/Windows domination will not last for next 10 years. Customers need cloud solutions (SkyDrive, Azure), need virtualization solutions (Hyper-V)… That is a good tries by Microsoft management. Microsoft has all powers to drive developement. They can become some kind of 'backend' technology provider all devs will use.

Look into feature MS! Time is going on and passing you by.
**Why not do C# next Basic?**
