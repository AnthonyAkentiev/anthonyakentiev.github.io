Some say that WP8 "rocks", MS will "strike back", Nokia is a great company and so on... Unfortunately, while Microsoft tries hard to find new CEO -> it seems like nobody wants to write for WP8 platform. 

## But(t) Why?
Not because WP8 is good (or bad).
Not because WP8 has clear (or messy) interface. 
Not because WP8 is Microsoft.

There is only one reason why i'm not going to make some Windows Phone 8 applications in the near future: WP8 market share is too small. **Imagine writing Desktop Application for Linux )) You will get nearly the same market share**

When starting to build app today i'd rather consider this order:
     * Android. Yes! the paradigm is shifted, market tells us - first implement app for Android!
     * iOS
     * ... ooohhh, i need some rest
     * ... maybe we will do some WP8 research?
     * ... hey, MS gives all tools for free!
     * ... ok,ok. Some folks won their free Nokias and need WP8 app. I understand
     * WP8

Today i'm going to start a list of Applications that are not available on WindowsPhone8 platform, but i NEED them. That is a real case scenario of mine, no fooling. Yes, the most basic apps are already in Windows Market, and some are not official. I will update this post, so new items will appear and some may become outdated.

1. airbnb.com
2. snapchat.com
3. gamecenter.nhl.com - 'National Hockey League' streaming video app.
