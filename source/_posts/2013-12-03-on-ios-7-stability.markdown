I've got 15 minutes before going to sleep and i'd like to dedicate this time to discussing iOS7 (in)stability.
I owned many Apple products but none of them were so instable like iOS7 does. 

I asked 5 friends/collegues of mine: 3 admitted that iOS7 is "slow","crashes" and "not as stable as 6th was", 2 sayed it is "ok". 
Really, upgrading to 6th version went smooth. As far as i remember - the only issue it had was - it ate a lot of battery. That was the first Apple's step towards Android).

I like iOS7 design, i really like it. 
I use my iPod 95% of time as a music/audiobook player - and i want 100% stability in these use cases. But my iPod does well everything but that!

Now i am listening to

* Music player crashes every day. I loose my position (not a name of song))) and it is very difficult to find it again in 10+h audiobooks.
* Music clicks when LockScreen is unlocked. Ahhhhh, crap. 
* I just can't find position with my finger! The slider is way TOO small... Shit. Seems like i'm getting used to big Samsung screens.
* Position is saved incorrectly if i pause and then start again. It is always minus 30-40 seconds late.
* Music player cant restore position in 50% of tries.
* Sometimes position freezes. I'm jumping back to 14:55 and then again and again. Oh, maybe Jobs invented some kind of neat DJ feature? But it really annoys me.  
* The interface is SOO slow! Samdroid is very-very fast when compared. By the way, i own iPod 5! Not that old and slow 4th gen.device...

Oh, Apple. Please do 64bit processing, do fingerprint recognition... But FIRST OF ALL - do fix that fucking iOS7.
