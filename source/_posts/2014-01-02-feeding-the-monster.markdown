Book "Trust Me, I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator" is written by Ryan Holiday, a young man in his late twenties who was a Director of Marketing of Ammerican Apparel. He has increased the sales from 40 to 60 millions dollars. Here is the [link](http://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Lying-Confessions-Manipulator-ebook/dp/B0074VTHH0).

If you don't know who Lauren Phoenix is -> go see some porn (and she is one of the cutest girls in this business, trust me, i'm not lying)). Simply type in 'Lauren Phoenix' in your Google image search - i bet you will see American Apparel first)) They also featured Sasha Grey in their ads to make a real controversy and more pageviews. 

I'd give this book 3 out of 5 stars. It is bit boring and i wonder if all that hype around this book is simply PR-manipulation (what this book's all about). Even though this book does not entertain much - it has many interesting examples of what 'marketing' does today to our lives. In first part of the book author explains why media is working like that and what is their goal today. 

Later author tells us why sources of pageviews are shifted from reliable (almost) agencies/newspapers to Twitter and Facebook. And why manipulations could be so easily done - nobody has time to verify the source. 

He also states that RSS is already dead (book was published in 2012). That was a good foresight. 

Ryan says that one day he understood that "when manipulation is done - one wins, everybody looses". And he calls this manipulative behaviour "Feeding the monster". He used to "leak documents", orchestrated fake tweets and comments, painted some vulgar pharases over bilboards... If you want to understand how blogging/marketing/news work nowadays - read this book.
